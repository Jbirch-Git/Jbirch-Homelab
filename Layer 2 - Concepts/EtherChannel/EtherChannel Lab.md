# Etherchannel Lab

In this lab we will be configuring Etherchannel on two links connecting from an access switch to a distribution switch. This resolved the issue of connecting two links between the switches and spanning-tree disabling one of the links due to a loop. These two links are now locally seen as a single link allowing for more throughput from the switch.

Assets in this lab:

Core,SW1,SW2,SW3

The Topology of this lab will be the following:
