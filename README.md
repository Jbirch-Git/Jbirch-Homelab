# Jbirch-Homelab

Welcome to the Documentation of my Home Lab. These are virtual labs made and documented by myself during my studies for various certifications.

I have the following sub folders and these are the technologies outlined and used within each folder. 

Legend:

The .MD file under each sub folder shows the documentation of the lab
The "Router Configuration" sub folder in the lab is a copy of the routers configurations in case someone wanted to bring this up in their own lab (CML,EVE,GNS3)


Dynamic Routing Labs:
-BGP (EBGP and IBGP peering concepts)
-OSPF
